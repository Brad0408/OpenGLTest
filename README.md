# OpenGLTest
 
## Overview
Got bored and thought it would be fun to learn opengl and graphics programming.

Currently this project has a basic [3D cube](https://github.com/Brad0408/OpenGLTest/blob/main/src/tests/Test3DCube.cpp), [2D textured objects](https://github.com/Brad0408/OpenGLTest/blob/main/src/tests/TestTexture2D.cpp) , ImGUI implmentation and a test scene loader

Huge WIP , probably just going to try random things I want to try and renderer or concepts to explore, like 3D texturing or creating a basic 3D platformer
