# OpenGLTest
 
## Overview
Got bored and thought it would be fun to learn opengl and graphics programming.

Currently this project has a basic 3D cube, 2D textured objects, ImGUI implmentation and a test scene loader

Huge WIP , probably just going to try random things I want to try and renderer or concepts to explore, like 3D texturing or creating a basic 3D platformer
